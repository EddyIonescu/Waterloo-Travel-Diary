/*
 * While easier to do, constantly recording a user's location using
 * GPS drains their battery to the tune of 5-15% an hour depending on
 * the age and model of their iPhone.
 *
 * This class encodes all logic pertaining to deciding the accuracy of
 * location tracking as to conserve battery life.
 *
 * The trade-off is between battery life and the accuracy of locations,
 * which is important since the data collected is being used to determine
 * user activities, their mode of transportation, and their route choice
 * if walking or cycling.
 *
 * Based on the above trade-off, there are some scenarios where location
 * accuracy can be reduced, namely when the user isn't moving and when
 * they're moving very quickly (ie. on the highway or train).
